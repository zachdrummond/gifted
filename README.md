## Description

This is an app that tracks all of your gifts in one organized place. No need for sticky notes or spreadsheets any longer! There is a table that organizes all of the gifts you receive from others and a table that organizes all of the gifts that you send to others. You can add new gifts, or edit/delete current gifts.
